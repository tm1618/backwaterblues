This project was created to be a volunteer schedule system that I could use to keep up with volunteers during a swing dance event weekend.
I created the project with the idea in mind that I wanted my volunteers to be able to go to the site address on their computers or mobile devices 
and see what their schedule was.  Since it's database driven, it also allowed me to update the schedule so that the volunteers
could see a current and accurate schedule.
